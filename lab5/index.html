		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types & Variables</h1>
		<div id="border">
			<p>This lab I was starting to use Javascript and learning how to experiment
			using basic Javascript data types and variables.  Also writing my codes using the
			console to practice and to copy and paste my codes because it's a great way to code
			and check in case I have an error to show me where to fix.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>It wasn't challenging starting to learn about Javascript variables and booleans.
			The files from Wes lab 5 file was helpful in seeing how to write the codes for this lab
			and a great reference to practice writing codes for Javascript to always comment
			about my steps to do.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>There was no problem in this lab everything was simple to do.  I was using
			Javascript to declare my variables for "make", "model", "color", and "year"
			to the vehicle I choose.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here you can see I have declared my variables based on the image of the Honda car I just used
			from the internet to used for my variables in Javascript.  And my Javascript file is linked to my HTML
		  file showing my codes for this lab.</p>
