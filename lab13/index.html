		<h1>Lab 13: Basic Debugging</h1>
		<div id="border">
			<p>In this lab I'm learning about debugging stragies to help solve my codes.
			Some basic debugging is checking my console to help locate where the problem is.
			Some strategies is dividing my problems in half, use working examples, rubber
			ducking, writing a failing test, commenting out, stepping throught the code,
			and asking for help.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>All of my preivous labs were working since I checked each of their
			console and nothing was displaying an error.  I didn't experience any
			difficult challenges this lab in creating a timer countdown from 30
			seconds and to display a message.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I didn't have any issue while doing my lab because it was simple using the
			HTML source from the question and using to refer to in my Javascript I mainly
			just looked up a working example of it to borrow the code and change it a bit
			to work.</p>
