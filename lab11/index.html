		<h1>Lab 11: Conditionals</h1>
		<div id="border">
			<p>In this lab I'm learning about how to use expressions, and setting if conditionals,
			add else conditionals, and else if conditionals in JavaScript.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>I didn't experience any difficult challenges this lab creating the conditions
			using expressions to show which house the name is going to be in or adding
			again an addEventListener to make use the input and output to show in its place.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I didn't have any issue while doing my lab because it was easy to set the
			conditionals based on the expressions to affect the names length to sort it
			into a house.  To create an addEventListener to my button to use the inputed
			data of the name to output the result of which house it will be in by how
			it's divided evenly.  I reviewed the powerpoint lectures and Wes's repl.it
			to help me create my javascript code.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here you can see I have successfully created a conditionals when you
			enter your name using an expression it will count the letters and divide
			it and depending of the results it will assign it to a house.</p>
		</div>
