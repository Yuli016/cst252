		<h1>Lab 15: Object-Oriented Design</h1>
		<div id="border">
			<p>In this lab I'm learning about javascript classes and redoing lab 14 but
			using a differnt method classes to do a the same thing because classes are a
			better way to do it.  Also writing a object oriented design about how
			to code a hangman game.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>It wasn't challenging to recreate lab 15 using the class method mostly it was
			just one part to edit and using the lecture powerpoint and going over it during
			classes was helpful to recreate it using class.  Comparing the two methods doing
			the same thing class looks more organized and neat compare to using prototype.
			Creating the object oriented design code for creating a hangman game wasn't
			difficult to break down the process of thinking how to psedocode the approach
			assigning object to javascript-ish pseudocode the program.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I didn't have any problems with lab 15 class codes or creating the
			object oriented design for the hangman game.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here you can see I have created a class using a constructor to list
			some vehicles I use to get around.  Also a object oriented design for a
			hangman game showing the step with the details.</p>

					<li>Hangman class manages the high-level game functions like setting up the
					board, looping through the turns, and asking questions of other objects
					to determine whether the game is over.</li>
					<li>Player class handles interaction with the human player, including asking to
					select letter or deciding the word.  It validates whether the letters are
					correct or incorrect.</li>
					<li>Board class handles maintaining the state of the board, returing any necessary data
					like if the letters select throught game completes the word or not.</li>
