		<h2>Yulitsa Pantoja</h2>
		<p>My name is Yulitsa Pantoja and I’m a second year student majoring in Communication
		Design with a concentration in Game Design. I live in Greenfield California with
		my family and some activities I enjoy doing are drawing, playing video games,
		reading, watching shows, and playing with my cats. The game I enjoy playing is
		Animal Crossing New Horizons. I have two cats named Kirby and Chi and they
		have been with me since October 2014 when they were kittens and are a very
		important part of my family. I have some experience in coding websites using
		HTML and CSS but I don’t have any experience using Javascript. I’m going to enjoy
		learning how to use Javascript to increase my skills to know how to create even better
		functional well designed interactive websites.</p>
