		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
		<div id="border">
			<p>This lab was created to help refresh me in learning how to make a local
			file structure on my computer and add index.html files to organize my files and
			create links to my other labs on my homepage for cst252.  Also to upload my
			files after testing them locally on my computer to upload them into the servers
			using Github for anyone to view it.
			</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>It was simple in creating the file structure and uploading my files to the severs
			because I already know how to do it since last semester.  So I didn't experience any
			challenges until later on when I start working in practicing and learn how to use
			Javascript to create more fun functional interactive well designed websites.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Currently as you can see on my page you can see my screenshot of my file
			structure on my computer and other images of my codes for this lab and my homepage
			you can view by clicking on "Homepage".</p>
