		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding & Problem-Solving</h1>
		<div id="border">
			<p>This lab was created to start getting into the habit of thinking about
			pseudocoding and problem solving before I actually start coding.  By practing thinking
			about the steps of some everyday thing like making pancakes by outline the process.
			And thinking what to do on the computer like making a rock, paper, scissor game
			outlining the steps and thinking how to code it by writing it in Javascript what to do
			as comments before actually coding.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The challenging part of this assignment is really thinking and breaking apart the
			step to do something even something as easy as making pancakes or the steps to create
			a rock paper scissor game.  Because these steps are going to be very important to code
			in Javascript.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I didn't have too much trouble but it was a bit challenging especially the part to think
			about the steps for the rock paper scissor game to turn into comments for Javascript.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>As you can see I screenshot the steps to making pancakes as very simple steps
			divided into their parts.  And also creating the steps for the rock paper scissor game
			step by step and added the step think how to make the computer to make into a js file.</p>
