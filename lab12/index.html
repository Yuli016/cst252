		<h1>Lab 12: Loops</h1>
		<div id="border">
			<p>In this lab I'm learning about loops and the difference between a for and
			while loops and how to write the code in JavaScript.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>I didn't experience any difficult challenges this lab creating the loops 1 to
			200 to print the multiples of the numbers.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I didn't have any issue while doing my lab because it was easy to create the
			loop since most of it was done in class and just added more ifs for the other
			multiples.  And using DOM to create a printForNumber var to create an element
			to print them on the HTML and within each if print the innerHTML to print out
			word and adding the appendChild to the outputEl.  I reviewed the powerpoint
			lectures for lab 12 and lab 9 and my repl.it to help me create my javascript code.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here you can see I have successfully created a loop showing all 200 numbers
			and next to some depending on it's multiples it will spell a name with 3 as buzz,
			5 as fizz, and 7 as boom all organized in a 3 columns.</p>
