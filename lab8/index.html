		<h1>Lab 8: Anonymous Functions & Callbacks</h1>
		<div id="border">
			<p>In this lab I'm learning anonymous fuctions is a function that doesn't have
			a name iddentifier and useful defining callbacks.  A callback is a function that
			passes to another function as a parameter, and the callaback function executes inside
			the containing function.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Some of the challenges I encountered was mainly writing the Javascript to create
			functions to use anonymous function and callbacks to create an array of a number list
			to square it, and say if it's even.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I didn't have too much issues doing the lab but reviewing the lectures and
			looking at the codes from Wes's lab 8 Javascript codes and trying to seprate
			the codes does help me learning about Javascript.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="border">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here you can see it shows my origanial array list and says if the the number is
			even by saying true or false, also made the number be squared rooted.  In the console
			you can see java codes.</p>
